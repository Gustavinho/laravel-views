## Grid view example

![](./grid.png)

## Create new table view

```bash
php artisan make:grid-view ExampleGridView
```

With this artisan command a `ExampleGridView.php` file will be created inside `app/Http/Livewire` directory, with this class you can customize the behavior of the grid view.

## Defining initial data

Return an `Eloquent` query with the initial data to be displayed on the grid view, it is important to return the query, not the data collection.

```php
use App\User;

public function repository(): Builder
{
    return User::query();
}
```

## Defining card data

You have to define a public function returning an array with the data which will be displayed on each card, this array has to include `photo`, `title`, `subtitle` and the `description`.

```php
public function card($item)
{
    return [
        'image' => $item->photo,
        'title' => $item->name,
        'subtitle' => $food->email,
        'description' => $item->description
    ];
}
```

These are the fields by default but you can add more if you want to customize your card.

## Customizing card data

The grid view has a card component by default with some data but you can either create your own card and use as much data as you need or just use your own card implementation, you just need to specify a blade file

```php
public $cardComponent = 'components.my-card';
```
