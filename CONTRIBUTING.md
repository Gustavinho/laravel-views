# Contributing

All contributions are welcomed, feel free to open a PR with your contributions.

## Here are some points to consider:

- Your PR must be making only a single change, if you want to suggest multiple features or fix multiple issues please open separate PRs.
- Your PR's description should explain what the change is, what is fixing, inproving or including, if it is possible add an image or gif with the result, this will be helpful as a documentation.
- Your PR must include tests if it is necessary, like with fixes or new features, besides, it must pass the Tracis CI build before it can be merged.
- Your code should follows PSR-2 standard.
- If you have an idea that will require a lot of work, make sure you suggest it in a new [issue](https://github.com/Gustavinho/laravel-views/issues) first to make sure it's admired before investing time into it.
- Keep your code clean. Clean means you're proud of how it turned out.
