# Laravel views

[See live example](https://laravelviews.com)

Laravel package to create beautiful common views like tables using only PHP code, inspired by [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/), these views are built with [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

# Installation and basic usage

## Installing laravel views
```bash
composer require laravel-views/laravel-views
```

## Publishing assets
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=public --provider='LaravelViews\LaravelViewsServiceProvider' --force
```

## Including assets
Add the following Blade directives in the *head* tag, and before the end *body* tag in your template

```blade
<html>
<head>
  ...
  @laravelViewsStyles
</head>
<body>
  ...
  @laravelViewsScripts
</body>
</html>
```

These blade directives are also including [Laravel livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) styles and scripts, after that you may need to clear the view cache
```bash
php artisan view:clear
```
If you are already using your own Tailwindcss setup you can set `laravel-views` to not importing Tailwindcss by default. ([Importing assets](./doc/laravel-views#including-assets))

# First table view
This is a basic usage of a table view, you can [read the full table view documentation ](doc/table-view.md)


Once you have installed the package and included the assets you can start to create a basic table view.
```bash
php artisan make:table-view UsersTableView
```
With this artisan command a UsersTableView.php file will be created inside the `app/Http/Livewire` directory.

The basic usage needs a data repository (Eloquent query), headers and rows, you can customize the items to be shown, and the headers and data for each row like this example
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use LaravelViews\Views\TableView;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use App\User;

class UsersTableView extends TableView
{
    public function repository(): Builder
    {
        return User::query();
    }

    public function headers(): array
    {
        return [
            'Name',
            'Email',
            'Created',
            'Updated'
        ];
    }

    public function row($model)
    {
        return [
            $model->name,
            $model->email,
            $model->created_at,
            $model->updated_at
        ];
    }
}
```

## Rendering the table view
You can render this view in the same way as you would do it for a livewire component ([Rendering components](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/rendering-components)).
The easiest way to render the view is using the livewire tag syntax:
```blade
<livewire:users-table-view />
```

You could also use the `@livewire` blade directive.
```blade
@livewire('users-table-view')
```

At this point, you would be able to see a table with some data, the table view doesn't have any styled container or title as the image example, you can render the table view inside any container you want.

In the example above the view is using the User model created by default in every Laravel project, feel free to use any model you have, the method `row` is receiving a sinlge model object and you can use any property or public method you have difined inside your model.

This is the basic usage of the table view, but you can customize it with more features.
